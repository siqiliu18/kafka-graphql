## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:
- Open a new issue using on the the designated [Issue Templates](https://github.ibm.com/innersource/innersource-ui/issues/new/choose)
- Answer all questions/sections of the template to clearly explain the issue
- Add any screenshots and resources to properly document the issue
- Include the necessary steps that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error for review and testing
- Attend [Office Hours](https://innersource.slack.com/archives/C044PMZB0HG) to bring up the issue w the team so it can be priorized in Zenhub

Once it's filed:
- The InnerSource project team will label the issue.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as needs-repro. Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked needs-fix, as well as possibly other tags (such as critical), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.
- If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the issue will be closed. If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.
- `critical`  issues may be left open, depending on perceived immediacy and severity, even past the 30 day deadline.
- The team has regular scrum meetings and will groom the issue into the backlog accordingly.
